## 📖 About The Project

Navigating large indoor environments—such as university campuses, hospitals, and shopping malls—is notoriously difficult. GPS signals are weak or non-existent indoors, leading to confusion and wasted time.

**Guide-AR** solves this by leveraging **Spatial Computing** and **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** to create a digital twin of the indoor world. Our system projects real-time, 3D navigational overlays directly into the user's field of view via **Meta Quest 3** or mobile AR, guiding them seamlessly to their destination.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Precise Indoor Localization:** Uses SLAM algorithms to determine position without GPS.
* **Real-Time AR Pathfinding:** Visual 3D arrows and markers overlaid on the real world.
* **Cross-Platform Support:** Designed for Meta Quest 3 (Immersive) and Mobile (Accessible).
* **Modern Web Portal:** A high-performance landing page featuring 3D glassmorphism and fluid animations to showcase the project.
